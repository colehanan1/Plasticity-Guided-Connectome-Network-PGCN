# Plasticity-Guided-Connectome-Network-PGCN-
A bio-inspired RNN that fuses Drosophila connectome constraints with valence-modulated plasticity. Uses reservoir computing: fixed realistic circuits for innate odor paths plus learnable dopamine-gated synapses. Captures learning dynamics and aversive-conditioning limits from hardwired biases.
