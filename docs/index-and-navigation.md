## 🎯 Implementation Workflow

### Recommended: Sequential (Week by Week)

**Week 1**: Implement Phase 1
```
Get [27] → Give to Claude → Claude implements → Verify 59 tests pass ✅
```

**Week 2**: Implement Phase 2
```
Get [28] → Give to Claude → Claude implements → Verify 120+ tests pass ✅
```

**Week 3**: Implement Phase 3 (with README)
```
Get [31] → Give to Claude → Claude implements + updates README → Verify 140+ tests pass ✅
```

### Alternative: All at Once

```
Get [27] + [28] + [31] → Combine into one message → Give to Claude → 
Claude implements all three phases sequentially → Verify everything works
```

## 🔍 How to Navigate These Documents

### I just cloned the repo. What now?
1. Read [29] to understand what Phase 1 completed
2. Run: `pytest tests/models tests/integration -v`
3. Expect: 59 passed ✅

### I want to implement Phase 2 myself.
1. Read [28] carefully
2. Implement all modules + tests
3. Verify: `pytest tests/ -v` → 120+ passed

### I want Claude to implement everything.
1. Read [33] (quick-reference-guide.md)
2. Follow the "Sequential" workflow
3. Each week: get prompt → give to Claude → verify tests pass

### I want to understand the architecture.
1. Read [32] (complete summary)
2. Then read [27] or [28] for details on specific phase

   - "Please implement this prompt following the 'explore, plan, code, commit' workflow"
   - Wait for Claude to propose plan
   - Review and approve
   - Let Claude implement
   - Verify tests pass

4. **Verify everything works**:
   - Run: `pytest tests/ -v`
   - All tests pass ✓

5. **For Phase 3 specifically**:
   - After Claude finishes, check README for new sections
   - Verify Phase 2 test commands are present
   - Verify Phase 3 test commands are present
